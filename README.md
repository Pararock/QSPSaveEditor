A save editor for QSP games

# Download

# Features
Load a save and modify the values of each variables.
Enter a custom command to run.
See changes between two saves.

# Issues
In some games, your first action after loading a modified save MUST be a move action. I'm still trying to find why.

If you have any critics or suggestion for future version. Please let me know.

# Future versions
My current idea for future version: fix the slow scrolling speed, better support for editing long string.
